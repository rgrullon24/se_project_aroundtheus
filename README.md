# Project 3: Around The U.S.

Around The U.S.

Project 3 is the first project we start from scretch. we have to creaete are own html sheet and create are own style sheet. This project is a little diferent because we have to create view points for each view point. For example (desktop-->tablet-->mobile device).

To get projected started we used figma to get are layout and measurments we need to have our project in the correct format. Some techniques used were flexbox and grid and also adding media queries.

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
